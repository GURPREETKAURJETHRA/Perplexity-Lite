# Perplexity-Lite
Build Your Own Perplexity Lite Using LangGraph, GPT-4, and Tavily AI

## Description:
- Delve into the fascinating world of creating search or discovery applications using cutting-edge tools.
- Unlocking Knowledge
By combining these powerful tools, I‚Äôve successfully created an application similar to Perplexity AI. This application excels at unlocking knowledge through information discovery and sharing.

## Key Features:
- **Real-time Chat**: Engage in dynamic conversations with other users.
- **Multi-Actor Architecture**: Understand how LangGraph manages actors and their interactions.
- **GPT-4 Integration**: Leverage GPT-4 for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Tavily AI Insights**: Explore rapid insights and comprehensive research capabilities.

  
## Requirements:
-  **LangGraph**, a library designed for building stateful, multi-actor applications. LangGraph, built on LangChain, allows for the coordination of multiple 'actors' in a cyclical computation process. This is particularly useful for adding cycles to your LLM applications, extending beyond the capabilities of a traditional DAG framework.
-  **Tavily AI**, an incredible tool for rapid insights and comprehensive research. Tavily AI streamlines the research process, from source gathering to organizing results, making it an invaluable asset for developers.
-  **GPT-4**, a large language model that's pivotal in the development of advanced AI applications.
-  Application development with advanced AI technologies: By combining these tools, I've managed to create an application similar to Perplexity AI, known for its ability to unlock knowledge through information discovery and sharing.
